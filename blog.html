        <h1>My Full Stack Dev Journey</h1>
        <p>
          I'm currently participating in the Full-Stack Track coding bootcamp
          with iO Academy. I will be documenting below my experience on the
          bootcamp and my learnings along the way!

        <h2>Week 2 - Command Line, Git, GitHub & Project #1</h2>
        <p>
          Day 1 consisted of learning about the Command Line, Git & GitHub. We
          learned some basic commands on the command line such as creating,
          reading, updating and deleting files and folders; changing directories
          and returning to home directory. We then starting learning about the
          inner workings of Git, how to initialise a Git repo locally in an
          existing project, checking git status, adding files to staging before
          commiting changes. We touched on GitHub, creating repos, cloning them
          locally and pushing our commits and changes to the GitHub repo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the week was working on our first project - a portfolio
          website. Yes, the very website you're looking at right now! This was a
          good opportunity to put into practice my new structured appoach for
          writing HTML and CSS, alongside everything else we've learned up until
          now. The task was to design and build a portfolio website containing
          at least About me, Portfolio and Contact sections. I think it's been
          pretty successful and I'm really happy with the outcome. You can read
          more about my goals, challenges and thought processes for project 1
          <a href="project-1.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Key takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New structured approach to writing HTML & CSS works.</li>
          <li>
            Use Git for every project going forward. Commit often, but only when
            something is done or complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spend time planning projects before writing any code - wireframing,
            designing, thinking.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 1 - HTML, CSS, and How the Web Works</h2>
        <p>
          We began by learning the basics of HTML & CSS. This included things
          like important HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors, properties,
          selector specificity, flexbox and grid. We also learned a bit about
          how browsers work, their rendering engines and last but not least, the
          DOM!
        </p>
        <p>
          Each morning we have a daily stand up to test our knowledge of what we
          learned the previous day, and then after this we each have an
          opportunity to talk about what we enjoyed, what we didn't like and
          anything we want to recap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main takeaway from this week for me was discovering a structured
          approach to writing HTML & CSS code to build websites. My previous
          experience writing HTML & CSS was a bit haphazard, hopping back and
          forth between HTML file and CSS file, implementing too many divs,
          unnecessary CSS selectors and properties.
        </p>
        <p>My new approach now consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Wireframing</strong> - Drawing a wireframe to help visualise
            and establish the structure of the website, and which HTML elements
            and CSS styles are going to be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML first</strong> - For this step, I will write only HTML
            to help nail down the structure of the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS next</strong> - Once happy that the HTML structure is in
            place, I will then focus on CSS and styling. If something isn't
            working as expected then I can go back and tweak the HTML if
            necessary, but it shouldn't change too dramatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Think responsive</strong> - Check at this stage how
            responsive your website is. How does it look on tablet? Or mobile?
            Make sure it works on all devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build with accessibility in mind</strong> - As developers,
            we want everyone to be able to enjoy our products. Don't forget your
            alt tags, labels etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Get the most important things done first</strong> - It can
            be tempting to get distracted by things like animations and hover
            effects. I like to think about what the purpose of the web page is,
            and focus on the things that are inline with this vision. Once
            that's done, then have fun with CSS animations!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Have fun!</strong> - There will undoubtedly be frustrations
            along the way. Things won't work as you expect them to. These are
            opportunities to understand what you currently don't know, and what
            you need to learn. Enjoy the process!
